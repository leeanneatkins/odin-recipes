        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This soup has three of my favorite flavors: tahini, lemon, and dill.  The lemon gives this soup a lovely brighness that can be enjoyed year-round.  It is super easy to make and can be prepped ahead of time as it reheats well.  I found this recipe at <a href="https://simple-veganista.com/">www.thesimpleveganista.com</a>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil or ¼ cup water (for water saute)</li>
            <li>½ onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 carrots, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>7 – 8 cups vegetable broth or water (or combo)</li>
            <li>1 cup whole wheat orzo</li>
            <li>2 cans (15oz.) chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>⅓ cup tahini</li>
            <li>¼ – ½ cup lemon juice (about 2 – 4 large lemons)</li>
            <li>a large handful fresh baby kale or spinach</li>
            <li>chopped fresh dill, to taste</li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
            <li>fresh cracked pepper or lemon-pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil or water over medium heat, add onion and carrot, saute for about 5 – 7 minutes, add the garlic and saute for 1 minute more.</li>

            <li>Add the broth or water, bring to a boil, add the orzo and chickpeas, reduce heat to medium-low and cook at a gentle boil for 8- 9 minutes, orzo should be tender.</li>

            <li>Remove from heat, add tahini and lemon juice (start with the smaller amount of juice, adding more to taste), stir well. Add the baby kale or spinach, give a good stir, greens will soften and wilt within a few minutes. Add as much dill as you like, and season well with salt & pepper. Soup will thicken upon standing, add more liquids as needed.</li>

            <li>Serve in individual bowl with your favorite crusty artisan bread for soaking up the wonderful juices.</li>
